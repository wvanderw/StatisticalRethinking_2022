As McElreath tells us, there are many kinds of golems and figuring out how to build the one you need to carry out the task at hand can be tricky. Figure 1.1 In addition, novel research often requires novel methods and the researchers may have to stray from the common tests to engineer their own golems. 1.2 Statistical Rethinking A lot can go wrong with statistical inference, and this is one reason that beginners are so anxious about it. When the goal is to choose a pre-made test from a flowchart, then the anxiety can mount as one worries about choosing the correct test. 1.3 Tools for golem engineering 1.4 Summary Session Info sessionInfo() ## R version 4.1.3 (2022-03-10) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) ## Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19044) ## ## Matrix products: default ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_COLLATE=English_Canada.1252 LC_CTYPE=English_Canada.1252 ## [3] LC_MONETARY=English_Canada.1252 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [5] LC_TIME=English_Canada.1252 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] bookdown_0.26 digest_0.6.29 R6_2.5.1 jsonlite_1.8.0 ## [5] magrittr_2.0.2 evaluate_0.15 highr_0.9 stringi_1.7.6 ## [9] rlang_1.0.2 cli_3.2.0 rstudioapi_0.13 jquerylib_0.1.4 ## [13] bslib_0.3.1 rmarkdown_2.13 tools_4.1.3 stringr_1.4.0 ## [17] xfun_0.30 yaml_2.3.5 fastmap_1.1.0 compiler_4.1.3 ## [21] htmltools_0.5.2 knitr_1.38 sass_0.4.1 "],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 2 Hello bookdown 2.1 A section", " Chapter 2 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
