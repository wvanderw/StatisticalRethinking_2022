# The Golem of Prague

This is a _companion_ book written in Markdown for McElreath's *Statistical Rethinking* (2020). You can set up your R console by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("coda","mvtnorm","devtools","dagitty"))
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("rmcelreath/rethinking")
```

## Statistical golems

The Golem of Prague and statistical golems (models) are powerful but lack wisdom. As McElreath tells us, there are many kinds of golems and figuring out how to build the one you need to carry out the task at hand can be tricky. 

Figure 1.1
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./_images/Zoom-emote.png")
```


In addition, novel research often requires novel methods and the researchers may have to stray from the common tests to engineer their own golems.



## Statistical Rethinking

>A lot can go wrong with statistical inference, and this is one reason that beginners are
>so anxious about it. When the goal is to choose a pre-made test from a flowchart, then the
>anxiety can mount as one worries about choosing the “correct” test.
